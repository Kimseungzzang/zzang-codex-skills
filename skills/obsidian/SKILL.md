Summarize today's conversation and save it to Obsidian vault.

---

## Step 1 — Daily Note

Find the vault path:
```bash
vault=""
for candidate in "$HOME/development-personal/obsidian-vault" "$HOME/development/obsidian-vault"; do
  [ -d "$candidate" ] && vault="$candidate" && break
done

if [ -z "$vault" ]; then
  vault=$(find "$HOME" -maxdepth 5 -type d -name "obsidian-vault" \
    -not -path "$HOME/.zzang/ctx/*" \
    -not -path "$HOME/.claude/zzang-ctx/*" \
    -not -path "$HOME/.codex/*" \
    2>/dev/null | sort | head -1)
fi

printf '%s\n' "$vault"
```

Never use `~/.zzang/ctx/obsidian-vault` or `~/.claude/zzang-ctx/obsidian-vault` as the vault. Those paths are session-context storage, not the user's Obsidian vault.

Read today's existing daily note if it exists:
```bash
cat {vault}/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md 2>/dev/null
```

Append only **genuine questions** from the user. A genuine question is one where the user is asking for an explanation, opinion, or information. Skip simple commands or instructions (e.g., "커밋해줘", "파일 만들어줘", "스킬 추가해줘", "푸쉬해줘").

For each qualifying topic, append:

```
## [Topic Title]

**Q:** [User's question]

**A:** [Your answer, summarized concisely]
```

Do not duplicate topics already present in the file.

---

## Step 2 — Project Note

Identify the project name from the current working directory:
```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null | xargs basename
```

Read the existing project note:
```bash
cat {vault}/Projects/{ProjectName}.md 2>/dev/null
```

Update the project note using the rules below. The goal is a single file that always reflects the **current state** of the project — not just a history of sessions.

### 프로젝트 구조 (Project Structure)

This section is the live reference for the project.

**If the section does not exist yet** — read the codebase to build it from scratch:
```bash
# File tree (top-level + one level deep, excluding build artifacts)
find {project_root} -maxdepth 2 \
  -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' \
  -not -path '*/build/*' -not -path '*/.gradle/*' -not -path '*/target/*' | sort
```
Then read relevant source files as needed to populate the sections below. Include whichever apply (skip the rest):
- **개요** — 프로젝트 목적, 레포 URL
- **서비스 구조** — 서비스/모듈 목록, 포트, 기술 스택
- **브랜치 구조** — 브랜치별 역할
- **컴포넌트 상세** — 주요 클래스, API 엔드포인트, 설정값
- **데이터 구조** — DB 스키마, Redis 키, 주요 모델
- **주요 플로우** — 핵심 기능의 호출 흐름

**If the section already exists** — do NOT re-read the file tree. Instead, derive what changed from this session's commits and discussion only. Update the affected parts in-place. Mark non-obvious changes with `*(updated YYYY-MM-DD)*`. Leave everything else untouched.

---

### Commits & Changes

- Add a new dated subsection for this session's commits and file changes.
- Do not modify or delete existing subsections.

---

### Implementation Summary

- Re-read the existing Mermaid diagram.
- If the architecture, data flow, or component relationships changed this session, update the diagram to reflect the current state.
- If nothing structural changed, leave the diagram as-is.

---

### Session Log

- Add a new subsection for this session (brief bullets — what was done and decided).
- Do not modify existing session log entries.
- If any fact in a previous entry is now outdated, add a note directly below it:
  ```
  > ~~이전 내용~~ → 변경됨: [새 내용] (YYYY-MM-DD)
  ```

---

### TODO

- Remove items completed this session.
- Add new TODO items discovered this session.

---

Use today's date for all timestamps. Write all content in Korean.
